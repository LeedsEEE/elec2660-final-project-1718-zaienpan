Project Title: Writer's Jam
This app is designed to provide composers with a "quick method" of picking chords for their song.
It is simple to operate.
First, the user selects a key signature,
This gives them chords that are diatonic to the Key they are writing in. 
These are "safe" chords, but they may not provide interesting textures.
For advanced users, they can select "free mode", this provides them with all the chords to choose from.

Users can randomize all the chords or each chord separately.
Users can select a Tempo that best fits their song.
Click Play and the chords will be played according to Tempo.
Stop and Clear All will reset the playback engine and chord selector.
